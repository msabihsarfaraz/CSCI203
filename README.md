1. Hashing method one is based on a Last In Fist Out policy.

2. Hashing method two uses double hashing when there is a collision.

3. Hashing method three takes also into account whether a key is currently stored in its home
position or not. But it gives priority to keys that are stored the closest to their home
positions.
